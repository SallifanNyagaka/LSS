# Leseni ya shule ya sabato (LSS)
The Seventh day adventists are known as the people of the book (bible). In order for one to study the bible well, they need a bible study guide. The SDA church releases bible study guides
commonly known as lessons 4 times a year which means they release these guides every 3 months. LSS is a mobile application in swahili that enables one to access the guides once they are released
in Swahili.
